This assignment got 2 parts, 
				part 1 for the Neural Network, part 2 for the Genetic Algorithm.

In current root folder, ass2_files are skeleton codes for part 1 and contains both java and python which
is your starting point, and handout pdf is the thing you should look at, and slides are the thing you can 
learn from it, jGAP is the project from internet for part2 Genetic algorthim. 

##Part1:
Part 1 provide the skeleton code for both java and python, you can start based on this,
penguins307-train.csv, penguins307-test.csv are for training and testing, you can see that 
they are duplicate and they are all the same.
Part1 is about feedword and BP algorthim, I get it down successfully, but I didnot implement
the feature of updating the bias which should be implemented in BP() method, if you can
get it down, please do the PR to let me know :)  
 

##Part2:
Part 2 provide jgap_3.6.3.zip and the log4j, log4j is in my src folder.
Actually, I didnot fully understand what I am doing in this part, all I've done
is just folllowing the tutorial on:  
		https://cvalcarcel.wordpress.com/2009/08/04/jgap-a-firstsimple-tutorial/

When I am doing this part2, I was very tired since the due day has already passed and 
I dont have too many lateday to use, I am purely chaos, so I dont think my code for part2
is helpful, if you want to learn something, please look at the tutorial above, corresponding slides
and other online materials to help.

In conclusion, slides and website tutorial that I post in javadoc may helpful, 
hope you can learn something from it :)


HINT: You can't learn anything if you just copy and paste all the code!
